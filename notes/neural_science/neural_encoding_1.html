<h1>Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics</h1>
<p>Neurons represent and transmit information by firing sequences of spikes in various temporal patterns. The study of neural coding, involves measuring and characterizing how stimulus attributes, such as light or sound intensity, or motor actions, such as the direction of an arm movement, are represented by action potentials.</p>
<p>The link between stimulus and response can be studied from two opposite points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Neural Encoding</strong>: refers the the map from stimulus to response. For example, we can catalogue how neurons respond to a wide vareity of stimuli, and then construct models that attempt to predict responses to other stimuli. Neural decoding refers to the reverse map, from response to stimulus, and the challenge is to reconstruct a stimulus, or certain aspects of that stimulus, from the spile sequences it evokes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neural Decoding</strong>: considers the amount of information encoded by sequences of action potentials can be quantified and maximized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Properties of Neurons</h2>
<h3>Axons and Dendrites</h3>
<p>Neurons are higly specialized for generating electical signals in response to chemical and other inputs, and transmitting them to other cells. Some important morphological specialiations, are the dendrites that receive inputs from other neurons and the axon that carries the neuronal output to other cells. The elaborate branching structure of the dendritic tree allows a neuron to receive inputs from many other neurons through synaptic connections. The cortical pyramidal neuron and the cortical interneuron each receives thousands fo synaptic inputs, and for the cerebellar Purkinje cell the number is over 100,000.</p>
<h3>Ion Channels</h3>
<p>Alogin with these morphological features, neurons have physicological specializations. Most prominent among theses are a wide variety of membrane-spanning ion channels that allow ions, predominantly Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+), Calcium (Ca2+), and Chloride (Cl-), to move into and out of the cell. Ion channels control the folw of ions across the cell membrane by opening and closing in response to voltage changes and both internal and external signals.</p>
<h3>Membrane Potential, Hyperpolarization and Depolarization</h3>
<p>The electrical signal of relevance to the nervous system is the difference in the electical potential between the interior of a neuron and the surrounding extracellular medium. Under resting conditions, the potential inside the cell membrane of a neuron is about -70 mV relative to that of the surrounding bath (which is conventionally defined to be 0 mV), and the cell is said to be polarized. Ion pumps located in the cell membrane maintain concentraion gradients that support this memebrane potential difference. For example, Na+ is much more concentrated outside a neuron than inside it, and the concentration of K+ is significantly higher inside the neuron than in the extracellular medium. Ions thus flow into and out of a cell due to both voltage and concentration gradients. Current, in the form of positively charge ions flowing out of the cell (or negatively charged ions flowing into the cell) through open channels makes the membrane potential more negative, a process called hyperpolarization. Current flowing into the cell changes the membrane potential to less negative or even positive values. This is called depolarization.</p>
<h3>Action Potential and Refractory Period</h3>
<p>If a neuron is depolarized sufficiently to raise the membrane potential above a threshold level, a positive feedback process is initiated, and the neuron generates an action potential. An action potential is roughly 100 mV fluctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane that lasts for about 1 ms. Action potential generation also depends on the recent history of cell firing. For a few milliseconds just after an action potential has been fired, it may be virtually impossible to initiate another spike. This is called the absolute refractory period. For a longer interval known as the relative refractory period, lasting up to tens of milliseconds after a spike, it is more difficult to evoke an action potential.</p>
<p>Action potentials are of great importance because they are the only form of membrane potential fluctuation that can propagate over large distances. Subthreshold potential fluctiations are severly attenuated over distances of 1mm or less. Action potentials, on the other hand, are regenerated actively along axon processes and can travel rapidly over large distances without attenuation.</p>
<h3>Synapse</h3>
<p>Axons terminate at synapses where the voltage transient of the action potential opens ion channels producing an influx of Ca2+ that leads to the release of a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter binds to receptors at the signal receiving or postsynamptic sideof the synapse causing ion-conducting channels to open. Depending on the nature of the ion flow, the synapses can have either an excitatory, depolarizing, or an inhibitory, typically hyperpolarizing, effect on the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
<h2>Recording Neural Responses</h2>
<p>Membrane potentials are measured intracellularly by connecting a neuron to a hollow glass electrode filled with a conducting electrolyte, and comparing the potential it records to that of a reference electrode placed in the extracellular medium. Intracellular recordings are made either with sharp electrodes inserted through the membrane into the cell, or patch electrodes that have broader tips and are sealed tightly to the surface of the membrane. After the patch electrode seals, the membrane beneath its tip is either broken or perforated providing electrical contact with teh interior of the cell. </p>
