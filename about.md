## Why Evolutionary Algorithms?
A wise man once said:

> "We are all prodigious Olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that
we make the difficult look easy.  Abstract thought, though, is a new trick,
perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is
not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it." -
Moravec

Current traditional methods in developing robots involve manual specific design
and formulation of equations, it can be both time consuming and expensive.

An alternative to the traditional manual method is a relatively new field
called Evolutionary Robotics. The field borrows ideas and lessons learnt from
the evolutionary process, and mimick the way nature "evolves" a design or
controller with Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming. This facinating
field of research can potentially levage the power of nature to solve complex
systems, and I wish to be part of the research effort in discovering what
nature has to offer.
