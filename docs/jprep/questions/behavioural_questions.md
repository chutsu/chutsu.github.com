- What are you strengths and weaknesses?

It is easy to talk about strengths. The trick here is to never talk about a
real weakness unless its something you've defeated. Many hiring managers are
hip to the overused responses, such as "Well, my biggest weakness is that I
work too hard so I need to try and take it easy once in a while". The best
answer is to discuss a weakness that you've turned around, such as, you used to
come in late to work a lot but after your supervisor explained why it was
necessary for you to come in on time you were never late again.

- Where do you want to be in five years from now?

What employers are really asking is, "Is this job even close to your presumed
career path?" Are you just applying to this job because you need something? Are
your long-term career plans similar to what we see for this role? How realistic
are your expectations for your career? Have you even thought about your career
long-term? Are you going to quit after a year or two?

Show them that you've done some self-assessment and career planning. Let them
know that you hope to develop professionally and take on additional
responsibilities at that particular company.

- Please give me an example of a time when you had a problem with a supervisor
  or co-worker and how you approached the problem


- Why are you leaving your current job?

Hiring managers want to know your motivation for wanting to leave your current
job. Are you an opportunist just looking for more money or are you looking for
a job that you hope will turn into a career? If you're leaving because you
don't like your boss, don't talk negatively about your boss–just say you have
different work philosophies, Teach says. If the work was boring to you, just
mention that you’re looking for a more challenging position. “Discuss the
positives that came out of your most recent job and focus on why you think this
new position is ideal for you and why you’ll be a great fit for their company.”

If you've already left your previous job (or you were fired), suggests the
following:

  - **If you got fired**: Do not trash your last boss or company. Tell them that
    you were unfortunately let go, that you understand their reasoning and
    you've recognized areas that you need to improve in, and then tell them
    how you will be a better employee because of it.
  - **If you got laid off**: Again, do not trash your last boss or company. Tell
    them that you were let go, and that you understand the circumstances
    behind their decision; that you are committed to your future and not
    dwelling on the past; and that you are ready to apply everything that you
    learned in your last role to a new company.
  - **If you quit**: Do not go into details about your unhappiness or
    dissatisfaction. Instead, tell them that while you valued the experience
    and education that you received, you felt that the time had come to seek
    out a new opportunity, to expand your skills and knowledge, and to find a
    company with which you could grow.
